* Consumer: Can search for businesses, filter by tags, and view relevant deals. Can also access business profiles to see ratings, menus, and deals.

## Technical Plan:
### Database:

* MongoDB is employed as the database to store information efficiently.

### Application Layers:

1. Database Layer: Utilizes MongoDB.
2. Business Logic Layer: Implemented using Node.js with Express for RESTful API.
3. User Interface Layer: Built on Vue.js with Quasar framework for a responsive and intuitive user interface.

## Technical Requirements:
### 1. Software:

* Visual Studio Code for coding.
* Robo3t for MongoDB interaction.
* Node.js for server-side development.
* Quasar for UI development.
* Git for version control.
* Jira Software for task management.

### 2. Hardware:

* Internet connection required for all interfaces.

### Technologies Used:

1. Vue.js + Quasar: Infrastructure tools based on Vue.js for UI development.
2. Node.js + Express: Framework facilitating server and RESTful API creation.
3. MongoDB: Non-relational database storing data in a JavaScript-friendly format.

This project aims to enhance the business-consumer relationship by providing a dynamic platform for real-time deals, contributing to a shift in consumer behavior. Businesses gain exposure and control over their profiles, while consumers enjoy a user-friendly experience tailored to their preferences.
